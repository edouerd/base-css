          <p>Urbit is often used for simple, markdown-based publishing.  This stylesheet is meant to make simple, text-heavy documents look clean, organized and readable.  And, to provide some basic layout tools that are easy to use when writing basic HTML.</p>
          <p class="mb-4">As an open source project, the design guidelines for Urbit are necesarrily open.  Evolving the look and feel of Urbit is intended to be a community project.  Criticism is welcome; criticism in the form of a pull request is even better.</p>

          <h2>Typography</h2>

          <p>To maintain a pleasing vertical rhythym, Urbit's typographic baseline (and all other elements) are sized as multiples of <strong>6px</strong>. This is also the base font-size, supporting easy REM styling. We've included defaults to make arbitrary arrangements of Markdown components to work cohesively. Additionally, all Typographic elements in elements are equipped with weapons-grade retro encabulators, to support dual marzel veins and prevent side-fumbling. </p>
