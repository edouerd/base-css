          </h1>

          <p>Urbit is often used for simple, markdown-based publishing.  This stylesheet is meant to make simple, text-heavy documents look clean, organized and readable.  And, to provide some basic layout tools that are easy to use when writing basic HTML.</p>
          <p class="mb-4">As an open source project, the design guidelines for Urbit are necesarrily open.  Evolving the look and feel of Urbit is intended to be a community project.  Criticism is welcome; criticism in the form of a pull request is even better.</p>

          <h2>Type scale</h2>
          <p>Our base grid is a power of 4. Therefore, our type scale moves in increments of 4. We use two fonts: Work Sans and San Francisco.
            Work Sans (Semibold) is for headings. San Francisco is for body copy. The type scale and corresponding HTML tags can be seen below.

          <h3 id="icons" class="mt-12">Icons</h3>

          <p>Icons are roughly text-sized symbols, usually implemented in a font set (currently Work Sans)</p>
          <p>Two ways to implement icons:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Use Unicode symbol directly in code, wrapped by an &lt;icon&gt; tag</li>
            <li>Use a predefined "icon-" css class (with additional positioning/styling presets)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>
            <icon>↑</icon>
            <icon class="icon-arrow-up"></icon>
            <icon>↓</icon>
            <icon class="icon-arrow-down"></icon>
            <icon>←</icon>
            <icon>→</icon>
            <icon class="icon-arrow-left"></icon>
            <icon class="icon-arrow-right"></icon>
            <icon>🅱</icon>
            <icon>🅰</icon>
          </h3>
          <h3>
            <icon class="icon-cross"></icon>
            <icon class="icon-ellipsis"></icon>
            <icon>...</icon>
          </h3>

  &lt;icon class=&quot;icon-arrow-left&quot;&gt;&lt;/icon&gt;
  &lt;icon class=&quot;icon-arrow-right&quot;&gt;&lt;/icon&gt;
  &lt;icon&gt;🅱&lt;/icon&gt;
