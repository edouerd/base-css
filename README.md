# `base.css`

This is the base set of styles for [Urbit](https://urbit.org).  

The goal is to provide a base stylesheet that is

- simple,
- pracitcal,
- and extensible.

That's it.  You can read a bit more about our thinking [here]().

## Build instructions

1. Clone this repo.

2. Run the following commands in `/base`:

```
npm install
npm run serve
```

This should open a window at `http://localhost:8080/` where you can see the test page.

## Contributing instructions
